# Tennessee Discs
Tennessee Discs is a full stack e-commerce web application for a disc golf company to sell discs and view and manage their orders. I built the back-end Web API using C# / ASP.Net, and I built the front-end using React.

## Description
Disc Golf is the fastest growing sport in the United States, so I decided to build something that's in high demand. Tennessee Discs is a fully functional e-commerce store to sell disc golf discs. Admin can add discs for sale and view their orders, payments, and total sales. User can view the discs available for sale, add them to their cart, and place an order. Users are also able to utilize the Putt Tracker component of the application to track their putting rounds and analyze the results.
